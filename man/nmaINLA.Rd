\section{Details}{

Network meta-analysis is a generalization of pairwise meta-analysis to analyze networks
of trials comparing two or more treatments simultaneously (Dias et al, 2011). Bayesian
hierarchical models are commonly used for network meta-analysis (Dias et al, 2011). The
default choice for performing inference within such models are Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC), for example using BUGS-variants programs such as JAGS. A deterministic approach
to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) are integrated nested
Laplace approximations (INLA) (Rue et al, 2009) which is a fast and accurate alternative
to MCMC. INLA methodology is implemented as an R package INLA (<www.r-inla.org>). Sauter
and Held (2015) has shown that INLA can be used for fitting many NMA models including
fixed effect and consistency models, node-splitting models.

This package extends the INLA implementation of Sauter and Held (2015) to Jackson
model (Jackson et al, 2014) and network meta-regression and extracts the
features needed for NMA models from INLA R package and presents
in an intuitive way (Guenhan et al, in preparation). Currently, contrast-based network
 meta-analysis using trial-arm level data for datasets with binary, continuous, and survival outcomes are supported.
 Note that the installation of R package
'INLA' is compulsory for successful usage. The 'INLA' package can be obtained from
<http://www.r-inla.org>. We recommend the testing version, which can be downloaded
by running: source("http://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/givemeINLA-testing.R").
