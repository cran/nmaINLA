#' Data for the Certolizumab NMA-network discussed in Dias et al. (2013)
#'
#' Data are available from a review of trials of certolizumab pegol (CZP)
#' for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients who had failed
#' on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (MTX). 20
#' Twelve MTX controlled trials were identified, comparing 6 different
#' treatments with placebo. The primary outcome is improving by at least 50% on the American College
#' of Rheumatology scale (ACR50) at 6 months. A trial-specificc covariate, the mean disease duration
#' in years for patients, is also given.
